# Neo-Tychonian Geocentric Model with Machian Influence

This Three.js project presents an interactive 3D simulation of a Neo-Tychonian Geocentric Model, incorporating the influence of Mach's Principle.

## Overview

The Tychonic System, proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century, was a model that aimed to reconcile the discrepancies between the two debating astronomical models of the time:

* **Ptolemaic System:**  The prevailing Geocentric Model, developed by Claudius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD, placed the Earth at the center of the Universe with all celestial bodies revolving around it. This model, without access to modern technology utilzing a system of epicycles and deferents such as in the Antikythera mechanism, had been widely accepted for centuries to accurately predict celestial phenomena.

* **Copernican System:**  The revolutionary heliocentric model, proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century, placed the Sun at the center of the Universe with the Earth and other planets revolving around it. This model also offered an alternative description for celestial phenomena but still faces resistance to this day due to epistemologic, philosophic, and even scientific frameworks.

Brahe's Tychonic System offered a compromise: the Sun and Moon revolved around the Earth, while the other planets revolved around the Sun. This model retained the Earth's central position at rest.

This project builds upon the Tychonic System with a modern interpretation, incorporating Mach's Principle. Mach's Principle, loosely stated, suggests that the inertia of a body is determined by the distribution of all other matter in the Universe. In this model, the perpetual motion of distant mass (Etheric Firmament Background Medium) around the Earth is synchronized with the Sun's orbit, reflectively simulating a Machian Influence.

## Goals

The primary aim of this simulation is to:

* **Visualize a Neo-Tychonic System:** Provide an interactive 3D representation of the Tychonic Model with a modern twist.
* **Incorporate Mach's Principle:** Demonstrate the potential influence of Mach's Principle on planetary orbits in a Geocentric framework.
* **Explore kinematical and dynamical equivalence:** Show how different frames of reference (Geocentric vs. heliocentric) can be kinematically and dynamically equivalent under certain assumptions.

## Features

* **Interactive 3D model:**  Explore the model from different perspectives using intuitive controls.
* **Realistic planetary orbits:** Simulates the orbits of the Sun, Moon, and planets around the Earth.
* **Machian Influence:**  The perpetual motion of distant mass is synchronized with the Sun's orbit.
* **Educational tool:** Provides a visual and interactive way to learn about historical astronomical models and Mach's Principle.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/TylerAlbaz/Neo-Tychonic-Geocentrism.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Run a local web server:** Use the Live Server extension in VS Code or another local web server.
4. **Open in browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Controls

* **Orbit:** Using the Left mouse button, click and drag to orbit around the model.
* **Pan:** Hold Shift and use the Left mouse button to pan the view. (Or using the Right mouse button, click and drag to pan the view.)
* **Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

## Future Development

* **Refine orbital mechanics:** Implement more accurate calculations for planetary motion, potentially refining equants and deferents.
* **Add more celestial bodies:** Include more planets, moons, etc.
* **Enhance visualization and scaling:** Improve the visual representation of the model with better textures, lighting, and effects. Refine size and time scaling to further correct for relatively accurate measures.
* **User interface:** Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling simulation parameters and settings.
